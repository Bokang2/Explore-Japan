      <h1>Customs and Traditions</h1>
      <p>Since harmony is very important in Japan, there are many customs, traditions and etiquette rules  to create social bonding between people. Some of the interesting traditions that surprise foreigners are:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Taking off shoes when entering someone's house</li>
        <li>Wearing a mask when sick</li>
        <li>Not shaking hands and not hugging when meeting with loved ones</li>
        <li>Bowing 45 degrees to show respect</li>
        <li>Making the slurping sound when eating noodles</li>
        <li>Symbolically washing hands when entering a shrine</li>
        <li>Wearing slippers when using the restroom</li>
        <li>Decorate one's house with dolls for the annual “girls day” and decorate the house with the samurai figure for the annual “boys day”</li>
        <li>Throwing beans at people who dressed as demons during the “setsubun” festival</li>
        <li>Eating a special meal called “osechi” during the new year's day</li>
        <li>Bathing in the evening rather than in the morning</li>
        <li>Participating in the firework festivals or bon odori festivals during the summer by wearing a yukata.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Japanese people always display modesty and humility. People often bow to convey the message: “I am not above you. I respect you.” Bowing longer with a higher degree of angle means more respect. Additionally, Japanese people have two religions at the same time: they are both Buddhist and Shintoist. When a Japanese baby is born, the ceremony is held in the Shinto shrine and when someone dies the ceremony takes place in a Buddhist temple. Lastly, in Japan, people are obsessed with hygiene: they take off their shoes when entering someone’s house and take a bath almost everyday. Many foreigners are surprised that there are no trash cans in public areas but everywhere is still clean.</p>

      <h1>Festivals in Japanese Culture</h1>
      <p>There are relatively a higher number of festivals in Japan compared to other countries because Japanese religions are related to celebrating the harvest seasons and seasonal changes. Each of the 47 Japanese prefectures has a different festival which usually takes place in the summer. Locals usually participate in these festivals by wearing a yukata and sandals. The most famous Japanese festivals are:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><b>Gion Festival</b> in Kyoto. The largest parade in Japan which started in the 800's when there was an epidemic similar to the Coronavirus.</li>
        <li><b>Awa Odori Festival</b> in Tokushima. A Dance festival held during the Obon-Week (the week when the spirits of the deceased are believed to visit the world).</li>
        <li><b>Nebuta Festival</b> in Aomori. A festival dedicated to ancient warriors in Northern Japan.</li>
      </ol>

        <li><b>Cherry blossom</b> celebrations in April. It is a custom to have a picnic under the cherry trees.</li>

      <h1>Tea Ceremony in Japanese Culture</h1>
      <p>Japanese tea ceremony is preparing and drinking matcha tea in a ceremonial way by using traditional utensils. The purpose of Japanese tea ceremony is to create bonding between the host and guest and also gain inner peace in our busy daily lives. Japanese people consider tea ceremony very important because it was started by the elite zen monks and practiced by noble warlords for most of history.  During the ceremony, the participants practice silence, respect, mindfulness and symbolic purification. While some Japanese perform Tea ceremony as just a hobby today, most people consider it as a form of traditional arts and call it the art of tea.</p>
